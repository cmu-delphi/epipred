\arguments{
\item{shift_cols}{a list of columns to operate on, as created by \code{construct_shift_tibble}}

\item{new_data}{the data transformed so far}

\item{latency}{\code{NULL}, int, or vector, as described in \code{step_eip_latency}}

\item{sign_shift}{-1 if ahead, 1 if lag}
}
\value{
a tibble with columns \code{column} (relevant shifted names), \code{shift} (the
amount that one is shifted), \code{latency} (original columns difference between
max_time_value and as_of (on a per-initial column basis)),
\code{effective_shift} (shift+latency), and \code{new_name} (adjusted names with the
effective_shift)
